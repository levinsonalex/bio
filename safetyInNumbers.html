								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>A short flash game that educates the player on better password usage. Each level has a set of possible passwords on the left and the user has to quickly attempt as many passwords they can to hack into the unsuspecting victim's accounts.</p>

								<p>I created the game at the "24 Hours of Good" Google Hackathon 2014. Each team was to code a game that taught its audience about a certain learning objective. Our learning objective was to teach players about the importance of using multiple passwords across all of their accounts. We story boarded our game, and decided to put the player in the role of the hacker. The hacker then attempts to hack into three different victims' accounts. The hacker must attempt to use a password bank that they "bought" off the black market and hack their way into the accounts before time runs out. They start off hacking a Grandmother's accounts (very easy because she is not very tech savvy) and progress towards a super hacker.</p>

								<p>I was the captain of our team of 5 people. I programmed and illustrated all of the flash aspects of the game, so everything hosted on Kongregate is solely my work. Nick Morgan setup our public Github repository and worked with Spencer Buja to create the website we hosted the app on. Leda Daehler helped storyboard the game and worked with me to decide the semantics of the programming. Our 5th member was feeling poorly on arrival, and left shortly after.</p>

								<p>We won 3rd place!</p>
